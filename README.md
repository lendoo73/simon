This is a FreeCodeCamp inspired project.

I did not followed strictly the user story because I did not want to build another circle- or squaer- or triangle-style Simon game.
I tried to realize my own ideas:
  - The menu a bit tricky: (click)
      Alien-mouth: change strict mode on/off
      Alien-eye: left: lower difficulty, right: raise: difficulty
      Alien-forehead: start game
      Info window on bottom: Click: open Hall of Fame
  - you can find 3 difficulty:
      1. Simon
      2. Super-human
      3. Alien-intelligence
  - I made some animations with css
  - I also made a Hall of Fame where stored the records of players. I did not use database, instead I save  the data to json files. Only  the top 10 players saved (name with country, date and performed turn).
  - If you choose strict mode: on, then you can save your record.
